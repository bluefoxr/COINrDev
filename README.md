# COINrDev

This is a development repository for COINr. I am using this for
backing up files that are also not yet included in COINr.

In short, COINr should work as a package, whereas
COINrDev has incomplete files and is much more likely to contain bugs!
It is also not composed as a package, just a bunch of functions.
